# Path-finding with Stochastic reinforcement

This is an experience of automated learning by using a strategy driven by stochastic generation of solution and positive reinforcement.

## Framework & Usage

It takes the analogy of cars driving on a pre-defined track.
3 classes make this framework:
- The track, class name TheRightRoute
- The strategy, example class name FinderStrategy_1. This is a basic strategy that can be refined. Feel free to suggest additional ones.
- The experiment manager, class name PathFinder
